/**
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 *
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 *
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
 *
 * However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the
 * number I picked.
 *
 * Example:
 *   n = 10, I pick 8.
 *
 *   First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
 *   Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
 *   Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
 *
 *   Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
 *
 *   You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
 *
 * Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
 *
 * Hint:
 *   1) The best strategy to play the game is to minimize the maximum loss you could possibly face. Another strategy is
 *      to minimize the expected loss. Here, we are interested in the first scenario.
 *   2) Take a small example (n = 3). What do you end up paying in the worst case?
 *   3) Check out this article if you're still stuck.
 *   4) The purely recursive implementation of minimax would be worthless for even a small n. You MUST use dynamic
 *      programming.
 *   5) As a follow-up, how would you modify your code to solve the problem of minimizing the expected loss, instead of
 *      the worst-case loss?
