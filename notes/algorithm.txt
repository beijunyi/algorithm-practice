1) When aiming O(1) time complexity. Try using hashmap. Maybe use it to pair up elements? #325
2) When dealing with graph or matrix question, think DFS and BFS.
3) DFS is easier to implement. BFS is better when aiming to minimise the returned value. #317
4) BST left child must be smaller than or equal to parent.
5) BST smallest element on the right must be greater than the biggest element on the left.
6) BST problems may need MIN, MAX values passed from descendants. #333
